Three blocks down from City Square
I cross the railroad tracks
Whistle blowing, wheels are sparking,
Stop and relax
BeCause the freight train is a-rolling,
A thousand trucks or more
And She wont brake for no one
till she hits the Savannah shore

I go walking Sunday morning, by the silver rails
I see a thousand churches standing strong on each side of the trail
The faithful in their Sunday best
Their Spirits joined in song
And as I walk on by them
The angels sing along.

On the North side a simple gift
loud with cheerful voice
On the South Side in grace amazing
Sweet the sounds rejoice
I Donʼt know all the reasons people stay apart
When in clouds of dust
Over rails and rust
They beat with the same heart

Three blocks down from City Square
It’s heavy on my mind
What twisted powers contrived to drive
A train between the sides
And the freight train keeps rolling,
A thousand trucks or more
And She wont brake for no one
till she hits the Savannah shore
